				Scripting languages such as JavaScript can be used to create more efficient and dynamically created web pages. Just as you can apply common styles to an external style sheet to be imported by all the pages of a web site, the same can be done with JavaScript code so that content that is common on all  pages  throughout  the  site  can  be  loaded  on  all  pages  without  having  to  actually  type  it  on  all pages.

				By using the document object and variables, web page content can be stored and written to the web page wherever needed, and on as many pages as needed. This type of web page is called a dynamic web  page  meaning  that  the  page  is  constructed  as  it  is  loaded  into  the  browser.  By  moving  all  the menu options to a separate file, you can then use the same code on all pages of the site resulting in more efficient page development and maintenance.
