    <h1>Using Search Engines</h1>
</header>
<article>
    <p>Search  engines  store  information  on  thousands  and  thousands  of  web  sites.  If  you  do  not know  how  to  properly  run  a  search,  you  could  get  hundreds  of  thousands  of  returns. Knowing  a  few  little  strategies  help  you  locate  the  information  you  are  looking  for  much faster.</p>
    <p>There are basically two type of search strategies, the Boolean and the phrase search. The Boolean  search  will  allow  you  to  search  using  AND,  OR,  and  NOT  to  pull  up  web  sites based on key words.</p>
    <h3>Ford AND 2013</h3>
    <p>The sample keyword search shown  above  will only  pull up  web  pages that  have Ford and 2013 on the page.</p>
    <p>The NOT will eliminate pages based on a keyword. For example, the keyword search below will bring up web pages that have Ford in them, but not trucks.</p>
    <h3>Ford NOT trucks</h3>
    <p>The  operator  OR  will  pull  up  web  pages  that  have  one  or  the  other  keywords  on  the  web pages up. The OR will give the largest number of returns.</p>
    <p>A  phrase  search  will  pull  up  web  pages  that  contain  a  specific  phrase.  The  phrase  shown belowis  enclosed  in  quotes.  The  quotes  tell  the  search  engine  that  you  are  running  a phrase search and not a keyword search.</p>
    <h3>"Quality Ford Cars"</h3>
